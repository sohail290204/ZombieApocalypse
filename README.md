**Zombie Apocalypse: Endless Runner** 

 Immerse yourself in this intense 3D endless runner, where you must outrun hordes of zombies determined to take you down. As you sprint through varied environments, you’ll dodge obstacles and gather coins to increase your score. Power-ups appear along the way, offering strategic advantages: heal boxes restore your health, guns allow you to shoot and eliminate zombies, while shields temporarily repel them, giving you a chance to breathe. Radio bombs are powerful weapons you can throw to clear paths and take down groups of zombies instantly.  Customize your character and choose between different skins in the settings menu. You can also toggle between day and night modes, adding a new level of challenge and visual variety. Additionally, you have the option to activate mouse mode, allowing precise control over your character’s movement and positioning as you maneuver through obstacles and zombie attacks. Stay alert, stay alive, and see how far you can go in this action-packed zombie apocalypse!
